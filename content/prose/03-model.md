## Try it out

Anyway, here's the model itself! Amazing how easy it is to embed this Hugging Face Space. You'll notice the outputs are very badâ€”this was cutting edge only 6, 7 years ago. We are alive in a time of miracles.

One of the main failure modes is that it repeats itself very easily, which it will probably do with your prompt.

Probably the most useful way to think about these outputs is to look at this repetitive nonsense and imagine it like a [puppyslugged](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fdeepdream%2Fcomments%2F3cc2a2%2Fvery_wow_such_puppyslug%2F&psig=AOvVaw3DUD3jvrC-L_dD_H5zBBku&ust=1755703101465000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBkQjhxqFwoTCIjgk--Vl48DFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) TV-static-esque image of pure noise. Out of this noise, as these parameters scale up 100s and 1000s and 10,000s of times, suddenly a picture emerges. But the fundamentals stay the same. There is something miraculous about this.
