## Rites of Passage

This crucible reminds me of my experiences with Nand2Tetris, back when I was studying the teachyourselfcs.com learning track (a real treat for my fellow autodidacts.) For months after work I'd try and get my CPU passing tests, my tiny computer working, my assembly codes compiling into binary. It was often _extremely_ frustrating trying to get these things to work and not knowing what to do.

I don't know how useful building a computer from scratch from first principles ended up being–I only remember small parts of the overall Nand to Tetris pipeline—but to have endured and stood victorious over its challenges added some important confidence to the overall way I've since approached the computer.

In the same way, I don't think I'm moving into a career of pretraining LLMs, but getting up close and personal with optimized training runs (at least, the 2019 version) feels like I've proven something important to myself.
