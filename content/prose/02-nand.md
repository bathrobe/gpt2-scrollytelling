## Rites of Passage

This crucible reminds me of my experiences with [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), back when I was studying the [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) learning track (real ambrosia for my fellow autodidacts.) If you're unfamiliar, Nand 2 Tetris starts with the student writing code for elementary logic gates (Not And, or NAND, among them) and proceeds all the way to coding Tetris in a high level language.

For months after work I'd try and get my CPU passing tests, my tiny computer working, my assembly codes compiling into binary. It was often _extremely_ frustrating trying to get these things to work and not knowing what to do.

I don't know how useful building a computer from scratch from first principles ended up beingâ€“while a few large and important intuitions remain, I only remember small parts of the overall Nand to Tetris pipeline. But what's important in rites of passage is not quantifiable, the knowledge gained is non-technical; to have endured and stood victorious over its challenges added some important confidence to the overall way I've since approached the computer.

In the same way, I don't think I'm moving into a career of pretraining LLMs, but getting up close and personal with optimized training runs (at least, the 2019 version) feels like I've proven something important to myself.
